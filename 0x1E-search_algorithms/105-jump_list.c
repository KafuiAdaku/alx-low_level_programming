/**
 * jump_list - searches for a value in a sorted list of
 *	integers using the Jump search algorithm
 * @list:  pointer to the head of the list to be searched
 * @size: the number of nodes in `list`
 * @value: the value to search for
 * Return: a pointer to the first node where `value` is located
 *			If `value` is not present in `head` or if `head` is `NULL`,
 *			your function must return `NULL`
 * You can assume that list will be sorted in ascending order
 * You have to use the square root of the size of the list as the jump step
 * You can use the sqrt() function included in `<math.h>`
 *			(donâ€™t forget to compile with -lm)
 * Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching,
 *			you have to print this value.
